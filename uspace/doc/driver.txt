driver design

1, multi-core, multi-process: adapter, queue assign


1.1 Best Case: each process has one/more queue of each adapter
	82580 8 queue, using this kind of queue 

1.2 Difficult Case: some process dosen't have a queue of some adapter 


2, multi nic: igb, ixgb


3, Story

3.1 CPU:4 core, NIC:82580

	1 core	: control plane
	3 core	: data plane

3.2 CPU:8 core , NIC:82580
	1 core	: control plane
	7 core 	: data plane


3.3 CPU:6 core, NIC: 82580
	1 core	control plane
	5 core	data plane 	


3.4 CPU:12 core NIC:82580
	1  core	: control plane
	11 core : data plane
